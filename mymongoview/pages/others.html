<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>

<p>Currently MyMongoView supports three actions find, aggregate and distinct. Every action comes with its own set of fields.</p>

<p></p>



<h4 id="find">Find</h4>

<p>Find actions accepts all filters and sort options.</p>

<p></p>



<h4 id="aggregate">Aggregate</h4>

<p>Other that just filters and sort options, you will be asked for aggregate related fields like <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1">group and </script>accumulator.</p>

<p></p>



<h4 id="distinct">Distinct</h4>

<p>This action will ask for key to find distinct values for. Remember it does not have limit so use vary carefully.</p>
